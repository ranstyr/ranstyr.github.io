# AngularJS sound cloud App

This app will use the SoundCloud API to fetch data and display it on a page.

SoundCloud is a platform which gives users access to a library of tracks. These tracks can be embedded and played on other web pages. The SoundCloud API allows you to query the tracks.

The SoundCloud documentation can be found here: https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/guide

App flow:

Allow the user to search for anything entered in the search box. The names of the results should be displayed as a list below the textbox. Only fetch 6 results at a time.
When clicked, the next button should display the next 6 results instead of the current results
Keep a history of the searches for the user on the Recent Searches Container. This history should display the last 5 searches and should be available for the user in subsequent visits.
When clicked, a search item should instigate a new search.
When a search result is clicked, it should fly to the Image Container, fade out and the image for the search result should fade in instead.
When clicking the central image, embed the track below the image and make it play - Enjoy!
When clicking the tile button tile the search results should tile in rows of 3 using their images. Clicking the list button should toggle back to list view. This selection should be remembered for the userâ€™s next visit.
Thank you! Ran.
